# Pokefutbol

A Pokemon-style game where you select a character (a football player) and you have to compete with a random character picked by the system.



## How to play

The game has 6 characters available to pick, each one is good at one type of attack
- Nicolas De la Cruz (midfield)
- Lionel Messi (attack)
- Cristiano Ronaldo (attack)
- Thiago Silva (defense)
- Aurelien Tchouameni (midfield)
- Josko Gvardiol (defense)

When you choose one, the game automatically selects an opponent to fight with your player. And this is how you can win:

- Attack attacks beats defense attacks
- Midfielders attacks beats Attack attacks
- Defense attacks beats Midfielders attacks

Each player has 5 unique attacks, when you use all of them, the game ends and if you win more rounds than the opponent you win, on the contrary you lose.
